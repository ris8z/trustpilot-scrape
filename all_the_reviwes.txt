I asked them to cancel the booking to book another room but they said I have to pay again another agency fee.

They also don't write references for other properties, so not sure what the fees get you.Second time, again a high fee, for doing nothing more then setting up a connection. Second host accepted me and took the deposit and a week's rent, then locked me out and sent a text to say she'd changed her mind. Have asked for a refund from HP, but all they'd do is allow me to search for more properties.usomg my original fee. Had to make other arrangements and frankly lost trust in the system so didn't want to try again.

{'author': 'Taymer Mason', 'rating': '1', 'title': 'Deposit is not protected  and they Protect unscrupulous landlords', 'content': "I got a job in ireland and because I was outside of ireland I could not secure housing or an Airbnb and I stumbled on hosting power.The only positive thing was that you get a room easily but there is a fee attached for this privilege.Your deposit is not protected with this company so if your landlord decided to keep it you can't do much.The site encourages you to book many places but just do one and wait until you are declined or accepted.Our room was not swept on arrivalThe kitchen was not very clean so it didn't encourage me to cook muchThe bed broke with us the same day so we slept on the floor for a few days until they got a new bed but it was a children's bed they got so my hubby slept on the groundThe shower had no water pressure so I had to buy a bucket and measuring cup to showerThe hot water was on at certain timesThe washing machine could be only used on weekends but sometimes the host said she needed it so we had to take it to the laundry mat.My landlord saw herself as helping and I agree to some extent we had nowhere to go but it was an uncomfortable time.It was hard on me emotionally and I was trying to adjust to my new jobI told hosting power I wanted to move on multiple occasions that I don't think this place fits a couple.Hosting power gave me generic email charging me again for a rebook.I did not want to disclose all I was facing because it was not good for me or the host. Maybe some ppl woulf be ok with that but I never experienced those things.My host on the first week told me she doesn't give bk deposits u need to leave it in for the last weeks rent.My host then told me half way in our stay that they needed the room for family. We were  going to viewing fot 8 weeks with no luck.I found something last minute and it was a move in on the spot and we took it. I gave my landlord and hosting power notice.My landlord said that local law overrides hosting power terms and conditions and kept the deposit. Hosting power has 511 from me for providing poor service and my previous landlord has 250 that is not worth fighting for. The deposit is not protected so if u can avoid hosting power do it.I need to get therapy after this.Hosting power did offer a free rebook elsewhere but there was nothing commutable or close to work. The landlord broke the lease early thankfully but hosting power has not given me bk my fee or part of it.Update and BewareWhen I was staying at the landlord she created a group chat as she had another tenant. She would send us strange text saying keep down the noise even when we were not talking or moving. She would say things like keep common spaces clean even when we didnt use the kitchen for days and her and her family were using it. We chalked it up to her being miserable but little did I know she was building a fake case against us incase we wanted back our deposit.When we confronted her in person she would say oh I didnt mean you I was talking to everyone in the house. I wish I could post photos here.Hosting power  copies and paste things you tell them and shares it with the landlord. If you are in the property do not do this as your safety might be compromised.At the end of the day without a landlords hosting power has no business. So it doesnt matter if landlords lie, the place gets relisted and hosting power collects another service fee and the nasty cycle continues in the name of solving the housing crisis.DOCUMENT EVERYTHING because it is you against hosting power and their landlords", 'date': 'July 21, 2024'} ,

As soon as I booked there was a place available for me elsewhere so I cancelled my booking the very same day. I did not get my service fee refunded and when I emailed I was told that they would not refund me but could allow me to book other rooms without having to repay a service fee. They are not helpful so I wanted to let people know of my experience with this service. I don't understand how I booked and cancelled in the same day but can't give me a refund on the service fee total scam!Replying to hosting power:How is it right that you don't even have 24 hours to change your mind. As soon as I went to cancel the booking suddenly got accepted. I have explained this and told yous repeatedly I didn't want to rebook with yous I found accommodations else where. I will never use this again as the customer service was terrible and I still think this site is a scam! I hope others see this post and opt to look elsewhere2nd reply:No it is not clearer and I would not book with your company ever again. There is not 14 day cooling off period for someone to change their mind. I didn't even have a 24 hour cooling off period. Your customer service was not helpful.

{'author': 'Lucalop14', 'rating': '1', 'title': 'Bad and expensive company', 'content': "My experience was very bad with Hosting Power. I rent a room in a house where the host didn't care about anything. He turned on the heater 2 hours a day during winter, many days we had no hot water, i found some slugs in my room. My housemate rented their room with another website, paid not any service fees and had a lower rent, while I paid 525 EUROS to Hosting Power. But for what? Nothing. They were not able to help me with these issues and just advice me to change of accommodation saying me that they will offer the next service fees. I asked for a refund of these fees as they just could not help me and they didn't care about that.In conclusion, this is a very bad company and I think they have a lot of fake reviews as it's so easy to find bad reviews in the last three months but they still have a good mark.", 'date': 'April 24, 2024'} ,

I been planning to move to Dublin and after a long search got a room with 2 months prior to save as much money to change my life, ONE week before my entry in the room the landlord sent me a message saying she couldn't take me anymore! I had already have 1 month to my current place to move out and there wasno going back for me, I was panicking for 2 days going back and forth to try and not be homeless and the landlord decided to take me back in as planned... as soon as i get to the house there were no keys in rooms for privacy, I couldn't cook, there was no oven, no freezer, I had to pay 5 euro to wash my clothes while i was already paying almost 1000euros per month!!! it was insane!! Not to say the landlord was a snob and terrible person, she started to pressure me to move out and few weeks before arriving I had to start looking for a different room in daft, I found it and I will move in 2 days! I am so relieved!! with this said I payed 500euros service fee to hosting power and when I told them she wanted to cancel my room one week before and leave me in the streets they never responded! they didn't care! and I also had to give the landlord a week and deposit in advance so I will be losing almost 1000euros from this experience.... I am still shaking from this experience, never ever again!! Huge trauma!", 'date': 'January 30, 2024'} ,

{'author': 'Ciné Club', 'rating': '1', 'title': 'the room was a real shame.', 'content': "I was extremely disappointed by this company. The host didn't respect any of the basic Hosting rules; she wasn't nice, she wasn't welcoming, she didn't try to make me feel at ease. She gave me all the information by message and never communicated face to face (not to say she avoided me). The kitchen was always dirty, the dishes too, and I had to tidy up after her. The bathroom was dirty too (blood stains, a poo on the floor...). There was work going on all the time (5 or 6 weeks in 3.5 months) and she asked me to be outside during those days. She did not always ket me know that they would come. She left the bedroom cold (7°) in the middle of winter. She even said that the room wasn't insulated, so it wasn't suitable for winter, but she still was receiving people. The host asked us to respect rules that were outside the Hosting rules (washing up with the kettle after 8am, not being at home during the day,...). She denied us access to the kitchen for several lunches. She prevented us from drying our clothes in the room at the end of our stay and asked us to pay for a tumble dryer outside (this was not in accordance with the rules). I'm not talking about the far too frequent noise from the family at disrespectful times. The host was contemptuous, didn't respect her rules, didn't respect her meal times, sent inappropriate messages when I tried to explain it.I sent screenshots of all this to Hosting to prevent another person staying in the room, as the conditions were so disrespectful, and they were neither understanding nor alarmed (they supposedly passed this on to the managers and never check back). The works were not mentioned on the advert.Finally, she didn't want to give back the deposit. After spending several weeks contacting Hosting, they only told us to call the police and to contact the Host ourselves (which obv. changed nothing) They did nothing more than send her messages. She would not return the deposit and they made no attempt to help us get it back. They guarantee that our deposit is safe and not to worry, but in return I have lost a large sum of money and the host has responded disrespectfully and there is no one to help us get it back.Luckily, I wasn't alone in the flat, which enabled me to get by for the duration of the tenancy: but it's unacceptable that this woman should continue to take people in. That place was a real shame, and Hosting allows rooms like this one to be rented and Hosts like her to steal from people.", 'date': 'September 01, 2023'} ,

{'author': 'Donal MacEoin', 'rating': '1', 'title': 'Scammy, pretentious, disregarding, extortionate.', 'content': 'I made a booking a few weeks ago, and paid Hostingpower 565 euro for a room until the end of May. I was a bit apprehensive to authorise the payment from my bank, seeing as it is a lot of money, but, I couldn\'t risk staying where I am now any longer, so, I paid it.After the payment went through, the next webpage  began to load, but stayed blank. I couldn\'t reload it either. I went and checked my bank account and the money had been deposited to Hostingpower already.I decided to email support that night. When they responded in the morning, they assured me that my card had not been charged. This is when I got really suspicious, and wanted my money back, but, I was also told to apply to more places to make sure that I got somewhere in the end. This gave me hope.On the 1st of December, the day that I had booked the second listing I chose, I got a message on WhatsApp. It said "Hi. Sean here hostingpower.ie. Just wondering did you get email."I assumed it was the host, and that I was supposed to get an email saying that my application was excepted.Instead, I had no idea which application had been accepted at the time. He was also busy for the next two days, so I had to wait. I ended up going to the wrong house, and eventually had to cross town to get to the place.The host was okay at first, but by the time he was asking for payment, he was getting a little antsy. It was as though he knew that I was a little mixed up about the payment. He ended up trying to charge me more than was stated on Hostingpower when I booked. (The website wasn\'t working great).This is where I started to feel like I was being scammed and decided to get out of there to make sure.I got in contact with Hostingpower, and now they are trying to keep my 565 euro, and not let me apply to other places. It was as though they knew exactly how it would play out with the host, and knew that I would feel uneasy and leave after arriving.It felt dodgy from start to finish. Seems like a \'legitimate\' business, run by people who can\'t resist a scam every now and then. Very unsettling experience.', 'date': 'December 01, 2023'} ,

I am a host for them and they claim to have viewed my property, this is untrue! They just required photos????I could of just put up any photos, this leaves it open for clients to be scammed. The reason they have 5 stars is after every student you host, they send you multiple emails for you to rate them on trust pilot. They have no phone number to contact them, and when you need support from them, they ignore your emails, these can be seen, as its very important to keep a paper trail when dealing with them.

It seems there is no responsabilities with the guests or even the hosts. You have to count with your lucky.Replying to Hosting Power: (Aug,23,23)That is a proof Hosting Power is a not reliable company.I've sent to Trustpilot my booking confirmation and the e-mails changed as you can see my review is verified.And Hosting Power are saying there is no book on their records?Furthermore,  if it is not for travellers why I would be booking a room to stay in the country?

The host changed his mind again so I don’t have a place to stay at the end and I am still paying this company for the platform fee but they didn’t provide the satisfactory service to be frank. Karma will come back to you all including everyone who works for this company no matter if you’re pretending to be Irish or actual Irish who scam people. Shame on you and your family.Dear Sebastian,I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the recent experience I had with one of your hosts. As a paying customer, I expect a certain level of professionalism and reliability from your platform, but unfortunately, my recent experience has fallen far short of this standard.I had booked a room through your platform and had paid the required fee in advance. However, the host informed me at the last minute that there was no room available for me to stay in. This was not only inconvenient, but it also caused significant stress and anxiety as I had already made travel arrangements and had only 9 days left to find alternative accommodation.It is unacceptable that a paying customer should be treated in such a manner, and I believe that more should be done to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. I would appreciate it if you could advise me on how to proceed in this situation and what measures you will take to ensure that your hosts are more reliable and professional in the future.Please attached screenshot for your reference. Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Tommy', 'date': 'April 20, 2023'} ,

After one month, the family told me that they needed the room because they had another tenants, so I had to leave in three days (it was Wednesday and we had to leave on Friday). I was shocked because I had a contract for 2 months more. I contacted Hosting Power on Wednesday morning hoping they would solve the problem, but they answered on Thursday that they would contact my host. When my host kicked me out with threatenes on Friday, Hosting Power contacted me and told me that they are so sorry and that I can book another room on their website with a free fee. That's all they did. They apparently talked to my host and saw that there wasn't a chance to stay in that house, so they only told me to find another room on their web (which it is not something easy). I was on the street with nowhere to live and the solution was to wait another day (hopefully) to find a room myself because they didn't do ANYTHING. I know that there is a house crisis on Ireland and it is difficult to find a place, but this agency doesn't make it easier. They tell you that they support you and help you(you pay a fee for that) through your time living in one of their rooms but it is FALSE. They don't move a finger if you are on troubles. I had to go back to my country and they didn't apologyse or anything. They stopped answering my emails and I didn't hear anything from them for weeks. I trully don't recommend this.

The fact that we could accept or decline a guest was also very helpful as it put the choice in our hands.However, I saw two drawbacks (hence only 4 stars) one, there is no phone number to contact anyone if there is a problem or an issue as not everyone has access to their emails to contact the company and two, on their website they state that  "you will are guaranteed\u200b to only host \u200bbusy and self-sufficient students or professionals. These guests study in a school, college, or university; or work in a company"However, they sent me a request from someone who didn\'t have a job, no income and was only coming to this country to "try it out". Now having said that I did have the choice to decline or accept this guest, but I would suggest not to promise something that you do not fulfil as it might be considered as false advertising. Overall though, I have had a very good feeling about this company because it puts the decision and choice in my hands. So well done and thank you so much.', 'date': 'October 18, 2022'} ,

My hosts were agreeing with me on this fact.- If you get refused from a host, you don\'t have any feedback, so it\'s impossible to know what is "wrong" with your profile- The rent is not above the market, sure, but it is not below either; the fees should be taken into account so that the rent is less expensive: 600€ a month for a simple bedroom and sharing any other space is... too much, had I had the choice I clearly would\'ve chosen another websiteOther than that, I am lucky to have found lovely hosts that are making me feel welcome', 'date': 'September 25, 2022'} ,

The fee is so huge for the service provided, as they did not do much more different than others than ask for your ID and not sharing it with the landlord/lady during the booking process. Without being able to see the house or have any contact with anybody, paying that amount of money blindly is not very trustworthy, but I am at my new home and everything went fine. I did not have any problem yet so I cannot tell you much about the client service other than they are very nice and asked if everything was okay when you move. I suppose that if you have a problem with your landlord you are covered but still a lot of money. I rented a room for 10 months paying 3 times less service fee than my current booking for only approx. 30 days with the same coverage or even more (others specify that they can relocate you or pay you a hotel if your landlord cancels at last time, etc).In short, I think they offer a good service but it seems pretty expensive for the market price compared to other companies.', 'date': 'February 01, 2022'} ,

{'author': 'User', 'rating': '1', 'title': "Don't move if this is your only choice", 'content': 'Hosting Power should be your absolute last resort when seeking accomodation. Honestly, I\'d rank "just don\'t move to Dublin" over "use Hosting Power" if it becomes your only option. The Dublin housing market is awful but Hosting Power is a scam that clogs up legitimate daft.ie listings and charges egregious service fees for doing absolutely nothing. They claim they inspect the rooms listed but if they truly did this, any sane person would have removed many of these listings. I was charged €600 by Hosting Power ON TOP of my deposit and rent, and they did nothing. Customer service is non-existent if you have any issues. My current space is not as advertised. A friend is currently homeless and looking for student accomodation in Dublin and asked how I got my room--I showed her pictures and told her about Hosting Power\'s fees and she agreed she\'d rather keep couch surfing for a while than use this service. I\'ve done my best to warn the UCD international student community not to use this service, but since they had the audacity to ask for a review I decided to indulge them by posting one here. Note how most of the 5-star reviews on this page read as though they were written by the same people.', 'date': 'December 27, 2021'} ,

Service fee is quite high, but obviously they did not inspect the house thoroughly (even though the house was visited). Also, it can be difficult to find a place sometimes and they do not notify you if your application is rejected, which is very inconvenient. They also do not check in to see if there were any problems, although they were very responsive when I showed interest in extending my stay. However, the website is easy to navigate and luckily, I did not have that many problems with my host and can eventually enjoy my stay there.', 'date': 'December 25, 2021'} ,

With regards to that, hostingpower offered me to change the room very fast and I appreciate that. However, hostingpower did not help in any way in relation to the return of deposit money back although the problem was the fact that the house, occupants and house rule was not as described on their website which was a disappointment.

{'author': 'Philipp Arnolds', 'rating': '3', 'title': 'I got really unlucky before getting really lucky', 'content': "I had booked a room in May, even though my stay abroad was only to start in late August - I wanted to have peace of mind that I already had my accommodation organised. The ninth host I asked accepted and everything looked fine, until early August - He had to cancel because his daughter needed the room now. At this point, there were barely any rooms left, but I got lucky and moved in with a nice lady. Two weeks after moving in, she said she had to kick us (me and my roommate) out. To be fair, she tried to organise a temporary solution with one of her neighbours. Still, she didnt give us the full two weeks notice, and I soon found out, that she offered the room again on the website, 2 or 3 weeks from that day.Thankfully, hosting power reacted quickly and gave me the chance to rebook, but since the semester had already started, everything was gone. So I booked a new room from January onwards, a wonderful host accepted, we talked on the phone and he said he could accommodate me immediately. I got really, really lucky, but it still doesn't feel fair.I feel like she should at least be obligated to take me back when she doesn't need the room for anything else anymore, so I would only have to find a place to stay in for a couple weeks, and not an entire Semester. We had a contract after all...I don't blame hosting power directly, but I feel like there must be some kind of safety net for the guests. The service fee is pretty high, so a service like that should be provided. E.g., it should be the host's responsibility to find an alternative living arrangement for the guest if they had to cancel the contract for private reasons. I feel like that would only be fair.", 'date': 'December 07, 2021'} ,
